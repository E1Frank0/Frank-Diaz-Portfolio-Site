<h2>Welcome to my New Website</h2>
<p>Hello there, and welcome to my new website <b>Frank Diaz Studios</b>, a website dedicated to show all my works of digital art and to use this as my personal portfolio for a future career. In here you'll find links that lead to my portfolio and contact pages, where you can take a look at my previous assignments and hopefully get in touch with me. Other than that, there's not much else to see, so enjoy.</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="images/moi2.JPG" width="300" height="250"><br>
<br><p>I'm an ordinary guy who likes digital tech, pop culture, and dank memes. I started getting into web design and digital media around my Junior and Senior years at University High School. I was inspired to learn coding after playing a lot of my favorite game Minecraft, and since then I've had a passion for pursuing a career in game and web development. I started taking basic HTML and CSS classes as well as a Photoshop class and I enjoyed the experience of learning those subjects in those classes. I am currently a student at Valencia College East Campus where I'm taking classes in Digital Media Tech and Web Programming. In high school I learned basic HTML and CSS, and now in college I'm learning those two along with basic Javascript. My dream and goal is to hopefully graduate from Valencia so that I can move to UCF and take classes in game design and I plan to hopefully work one day in the video game and web development industry. I also plan on hopefully working on personal projects such as small sites and mods for games.</p>
