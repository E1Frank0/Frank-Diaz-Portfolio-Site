<h2>Portfolio</h2>
<p>Here is my portfolio showing off all the works of digital art that I have created so far in college. Please make yourself comfortable and enjoy what i have to offer.</p>
<h2>Photoshop</h2>
<img src="Diaz_Frank_Photoshop.jpg" width="450" height="350"><br>
<p>This is my first project for my Introduction to Digital Media class in college. All I had to do was make a Photshop collage of my own choise. I decided to duplicate myself and have my duplicates do random stuff in my room with a couple of "guests".</p><br>
<h2>Illustrator</h2>
